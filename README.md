# Potential FAQ

- Can this be used as a launcher?
  - No. But if you do want a launcher, check out Revo Launcher. More complete than this, but is more intended for phones. Will add more details on this later.
- Does this have games?
  - No.
    - However in theory it may be possible to add some.
- Will there be Wiimote support?
  - One day, but not 100%, as I don't have all the best tech needed for it.
