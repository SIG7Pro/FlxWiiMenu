# FlxWii Menu
 Recreation of the Wii Menu in HaxeFlixel. Aiming to be as accurate as possible.

Code hasn't been reflected to the updated file system for the graphics. Lots of things are to change.

# Goals

- Recreate the Wii Menu as accurately as possible.
- Make a template for similar menus. / Have some customizability.
- Remake other versions of the Wii Menu. (Such as say v2E of the Wii rather than v4.3U. So more versions and languages and regiones.)
  - Currently recreating version 4.3 (USA).

# Progress

- Wii Menu Recreation 3%~ - [`__________`]
- Other Menus 0% - [`__________`]

# Potential FAQ

- Can this be used as a launcher for apps/games?
  - No. But if you do want a launcher, check out [Revo Launcher](https://github.com/KaruzoHikari/Revo-Launcher/releases). More complete than this, but is more intended for phones. Has a Content Hub and some themes and whatnote.
- Does this have games?
  - No.
    - However in theory it may be possible to add some. No promises.
- Will there be Wiimote support?
  - One day, but not 100%, as I don't have all the best tech needed for it and no clue how to implement cursor position in relation to say the Sensor Bar or Guitar Hero controller.
  - Also to be noted that multiple Wii Remote support and Pro Controller support will **not** be supported as I don't have the hardware for it.
